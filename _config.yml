  I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr" target="_blank">KAIST NMSL</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>, with close collaboration with <a href="https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html" target="_blank">Prof. Jinwoo Shin</a>. I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, also under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I completed my B.S. in Computing at KAIST, graduating Magna Cum Laude.
  
  My research interests include end-user machine learning, including mobile AI, adaptation, and personalization. I am currently focusing on **overcoming failures in test-time adaptation**. 
  My recent work includes "BiTTA" (ICML 2025), "AETTA" (CVPR 2024), and "SoTTA" (NeurIPS 2023), which focus on (1) adaptation with user guidance,
  (2) estimating adaptation accuracy without labeled data, and (3) adaptation with challenging noisy data streams, emphasizing the robustness and reliability of test-time adaptation.
