  I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr" target="_blank">KAIST NMSL</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, also under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I completed my B.S. in Computing at KAIST, graduating Magna Cum Laude.
  
  My research interests include machine learning adaptation and personalization, with a particular focus on robust and reliable test-time adaptation without any source or labeled data. My recent work includes "AETTA" (CVPR 2024) and "SoTTA" (NeurIPS 2023), which focus on estimating accuracy during test-time adaptation without labeled data and address the challenges of adapting models to noisy data streams, emphasizing the robustness and reliability of test-time adaptation.
# Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

# You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
