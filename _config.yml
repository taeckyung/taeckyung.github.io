# About Section
# about_title: About Me (Use this to override about section title)
about_profile_image: images/profile.jpg
about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr" target="_blank">KAIST NMSL</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>, with close collaboration with <a href="https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html" target="_blank">Prof. Jinwoo Shin</a> and <a href="https://taesikgong.com" target="_blank">Prof. Taesik Gong</a>. I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, also under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/" target="_blank">Prof. Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I completed my B.S. in Computing at KAIST, graduating Magna Cum Laude.
  
  My research interests include machine learning for end users, including mobile AI, model adaptation, and personalization. I am currently focusing on model adaptation in inference time (test-time adaptation). 
  My recent work includes "BiTTA" (ICML 2025), "AETTA" (CVPR 2024), and "SoTTA" (NeurIPS 2023), which focus on (1) RL-inspired adaptation with a few user feedback,
  (2) estimating adaptation performance without labeled data, and (3) adaptation with challenging noisy data streams, emphasizing the robustness and reliability of test-time adaptation.
